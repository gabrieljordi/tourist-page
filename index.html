      <h1>Porto, Portugal</h1>
      <!-- <h2>Portugal's Charming Second City</h2>
      <p>Porto, the second largest metropolitan area in Portugal after Lisbon, is located on the Douro River where it
        flows into the Atlantic. The city is home less than 240,000 people in the city center (about 2.4 million in the
        greater metropolitan area) and has a small city's feel and friendliness. But it's also a thriving international
        business city, with many expats finding all the amenities they need, including an international airport.</p>

          Porto, the capital of the North, is rapidly becoming the top choice for visitors in Portugal. And it takes
          advantage of its own contrasts; the narrow, dark, and even faded streets of the historic center come alive
          when you reach the Cais da Ribeira, with its houses boasting old, renovated, and colorful facades.
